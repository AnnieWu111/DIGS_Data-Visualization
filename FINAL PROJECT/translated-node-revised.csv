From the fact that he disagreed with Jia Yucun's failure to ruin Shi Daizi for a few fans, treating You Erjie's death sincerely, and dissuading Wang Xifeng to give Caixia to Wang'er's son with bad moral character, it can be seen that he is sympathetic and has a bottom line in his work, and does not exploit others as a prince of his aristocratic family.
